312655917) CHUCK
[outside train] {angryA}Thứ lỗi tôi, con trai?
312655912) LEE
[outside train] {angryB}Tôi đã nghe anh nói với cô ấy rằng cô ấy sẽ chết; rằng cô ấy sẽ như Duck. {angryC}Tại sao anh không đi và làm điều đó?

[outside train] {sadB}Bởi vì cô ấy sẽ bị vậy.
312655915) CHUCK
[outside train] {sadB}Bởi vì cô ấy sẽ bị vậy.
312655914) LEE

[outside train] {thinkingB}Giờ cả hai chúng ta đều sợ.
312655924) CHUCK
{happyA}Giờ I've gone and done it. I've ticked off the papa goose.
312655925) CHUCK
{thinkingB}Ya always hear about the mama goose but the papa goose is the one that'll sneak up and put a real dent in your behind.
312655926) CHUCK

I figure it out.
312655935) LEE
{angryA}I figure it out.
312655933) 
We find a boat.
312655937) LEE

312655940) CHUCK
{happyA}Oh! Well then! You do have it all figured out! {angryA}Nevermind.
312655942) CHUCK
{angryA}That's what I reckoned.
312655943) CHUCK
{fearA}Look, sit down with the girl and hash it out. Find a map for Christ's sake -- I'd give you one if I had it.
312655944) CHUCK
{thinkingA}And if something were to happen to you...
312655945) LEE
{angryA}It won't.
312655946) CHUCK
{fearC}If it WERE, {fearA}you gotta prepare the girl. Teach her to use a weapon and {fearB}for criminy, cut that hair.
312655947) 
Like a gun? Are you kidding me?

She's a little girl.
312655962) LEE
{thinkingB}She's a little girl.
312655949) 
I'm not a barber.
312655956) LEE
{thinkingB}I'm not a barber.
312655951) CHUCK
{angryA}Are you listenin to me? For fuck's sake -- I shouldn't even have to be telling you this.
312655952) CHUCK
{thinkingA}Find some scissors in my pack and take care of that hair before a walker does it for you.
312655958) CHUCK
{thinkingA}Find some scissors in my pack and take care of that hair before a walker does it for you.

You're gonna live with the consequences either way.
312655957) CHUCK
{thinkingA}It ain't gotta be STYLED, {thinkingB}Jesus.
312655960) LEE
{sadA}Okay.
312655961) CHUCK
{sadA}Explain to her how they work and to not be afraid.
312655963) CHUCK
{angryA}She'll die a little girl if you treat her like one.
312655964) CHUCK
{angryA}You gotta consider her a living person. That's it. You're either living or you're not. You ain't little, you ain't a girl, you ain't a boy, you ain't strong or smart. You're alive.
312655972) CHUCK
{angryA}You gotta consider her a living person. That's it. You're either living or you're not. You ain't little, you ain't a girl, you ain't a boy, you ain't strong or smart. You're alive.

312655967) CHUCK
{thinkingA}You got her running around with a mop that's gonna act like velcro to any hands swingin' its way.
312655970) LEE
{thinkingB}Like a gun? {angryA}Are you kidding me?
312655971) CHUCK
{sadA}What? She's too young to handle one? There ain't too young, not anymore.
312655976) CHUCK
{sadA}I don't mean to tell you how to do your job, but too many people have died already...
312655977) LEE
{sadB}They have.
312655978) CHUCK
{sadB}And seein' another little girl die might just do me in.
312655979) LEE
{thinkingB}I hear you. A plan, a haircut and a gun. It's good advice.
312655980) CHUCK
{sadA}It's something.
312655981) LEE
{thinkingA}I found those scissors in your pack.
312655982) CHUCK
{happyB}Oh, good. Get to snippin'.
312655983) LEE

312655984) CHUCK
{thinkingB}That's where I woulda looked.
312655985) LEE

312655991) LEE
{happyA}Well, the girl can shoot.
312655992) CHUCK
{sadA}It doesn't have to be pretty.
312655993) LEE
{thinkingB}Probably will be before too long.{sadB}
312655994) CHUCK

312655995) CHUCK
{thinkingA}You get that hair sorted?
312655996) LEE
{normalD}Yeah. I don't think she cares for it.
312655999) CHUCK
