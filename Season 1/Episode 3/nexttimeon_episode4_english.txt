We're almost at the river! You want to get on a boat, or you want to wait around until the walkers figure out we're here?
312762370) KENNY
Or leave him.
312762371) CHRISTA
I don't know how much longer he can keep on like this. If his leg gets any worse we're going to have to carry him.
312762372) LEE
[aggressive] Who the hell is this? Answer me, dammit!
312762373) CAMPMAN
If I were you, I'd get out of the street. Now.
312762374) CHRISTA
So, when were you going to tell us about the radio?
312762375) LEE
[forceful/angry] Who have you been talking to?
312762376) LEE
[shouting, aggressive] You come back here, I'll kill you! You understand? I will kill you!
312762377) BEN
[urgent/freaked out] Lee, you need to get up here now.
312762378) LEE
What's wrong?
312762379) BEN
It's Kenny.
312762380) KENNY
You have no idea what I'm going through. And you sure as shit don't know a damn thing about grief.
312762381) BEN
I've been thinking about telling him the truth. That it's my fault Duck and Katjaa got killed.
312762382) KENNY
[still fuming/drunk] This is the only fucking thing I have left, and you want to take that from me, too? Fuck you!
312762383) VERNON
Who are you?
312762384) LEE
We need to focus on finding a boat right now, Clem. Like we talked about on the train.
312762385) LEE
I know I promised that we'd find your parents. But Savannah's more dangerous than I thought it would be.
312762386) LEE
We can still leave, Clem. Just you and me. But Savannah's more dangerous than I thought.
