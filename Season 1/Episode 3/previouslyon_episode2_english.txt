312745987) KENNY
You've been good to me and my family.
312745988) KENNY
I gotta look out for my family.  I gotta know that whoever I take with me is gonna be looking out for Kat and Duck.

312745991) DUCK

312745993) LEE
Word's gettin' out that you wanna leave the motor inn.
312745994) KENNY
Well, "here" isn't doing us any good.  You should think about coming with us.  You and Clem.
312745995) BANDIT2

312746000) LARRY

312746001) LILLY

312746009) LEE
We have to take this, Clementine.  We need it to survive.
312746010) JOLENE
Don't worry little girl.  Bandits got their eye on that dairy.  As long as they keep getting food from them, you'll be safe.
312746011) LEE
[to Clementine]You're right. We shouldn't take this.
312746012) KENNY
The rest of us are taking this stuff.
312746013) KENNY
You saved Duck from those monsters...
